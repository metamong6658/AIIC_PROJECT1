# AIIC_PROJECT1
Project : 
1. Design and Implementation High-level CNN model(classification dogs vs cats)
2. Quantize FP32 to INT8 for RTL design
3. Design and Implementation RTL-level architecture equivalent to High-level model

Data : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/data

* My Design has some significant system level problem. This is not matched for 2D-convolution steps.
* You can Change Convolutio layer to Systolic Array or Adder tree or etc...
